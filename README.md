# OligoGen-In-Silico-Oligonucleotide-Library-Generator
This repository contains a Python script that generates randomized oligonucleotide libraries based on user-defined sequence patterns and nucleotide composition ratios. The generated sequences are output in FASTA format, making this tool suitable for applications in aptamer discovery, in silico SELEX studies, and combinatorial DNA/RNA design.
